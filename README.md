# 👨🏻‍👩🏻‍👧🏻‍👦🏻 Grahak Sakshi: Synergistic ML and IoT Hybridisation for Advanced Emotion Detection
Welcome to Grahak Sakshi, an efficient approach that integrates ML and IoT to advance emotion detection. Using CNNs, it detects real-time facial expressions (Happy, Sad, Neutral) trained on labeled datasets. Leveraging IoT, it enhances real-time capabilities by seamlessly integrating with IoT devices and sensors, optimizing data collection. This synergy not only boosts accuracy but also opens new possibilities for interactive, context-aware applications and ethical AI systems.
